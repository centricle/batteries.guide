## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Server runs on http://localhost:4321/ by default. If port 4321 is in use:

```bash
npm run dev -- --port 5000
```

## Deployment

Automatically deploys to Netlify when pushed to main branch.

```bash
npm run build
```

## Contributing

This project aims to be a comprehensive, objective database of battery specifications. Contributions welcome for:

- Additional battery types and specifications
- Corrections to existing data (with proper source citations)
- New features and improvements
- Documentation updates

All data must be sourced from manufacturer datasheets or industry standards.

## Data Sources & Quality

All data is sourced from manufacturer specifications and industry standards including:
- IEC 60086 series (primary batteries)
- ANSI C18 series
- Manufacturer datasheets (Energizer, Duracell, Panasonic, Samsung, LG, Sony)
- Industry reference materials

**Trusted Sources Policy**: Only sources from verified domains are displayed on battery pages to maintain data quality and credibility. This includes manufacturer websites, standards organizations, established technical references (Battery University), trusted retailers (Digikey, Mouser), and Wikipedia.
